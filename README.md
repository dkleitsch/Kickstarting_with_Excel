# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to assist Louise in improving the outcome of her next Kickstarter campaign.  In this instance, she was interested in discovering outcomes based on their launch date and funding goals.  
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Using Excel pivot tables and pivot charts, the analysis of theater outcomes based on launch date was completed.  The results of the analysis can be found in [Kickstarter_Challenge](https://github.com/dkleitsch/Kickstarting_with_Excel/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.zip).  The following image shows theater outcomes based on launch date. ---![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://github.com/dkleitsch/Kickstarting_with_Excel/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
