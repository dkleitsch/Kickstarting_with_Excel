# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to assist Louise in improving the outcome of her next Kickstarter campaign.  In this instance, she was interested in discovering outcomes based on their launch date and funding goals.  
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Using Excel pivot tables and pivot charts, the analysis of theater outcomes based on launch date was completed.  The results of the analysis can be found in [Kickstarter_Challenge](https://github.com/dkleitsch/Kickstarting_with_Excel/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.zip).  The following image shows theater outcomes based on the launch date.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
After creating a new table using the COUNTIFS and SUM functions, the analysis of theater outcomes based on funding goals was completed.  The number and percentage of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns were calculated and then the percentages were displayed in a line chart. The results of the analysis can be found in [Kickstarter_Challenge](https://github.com/dkleitsch/Kickstarting_with_Excel/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.zip).

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I encountered a challenge in making the line chart for the outcomes based on the funding goals section of this project.  I assumed I needed to make a pivot table in order to create the chart, which turned out not to be the case.  I spent a while trying to get the pivot table to work.  Finally, I decided to try making a chart without a pivot table and I got Excel to create the chart.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on the Launch Date?
The month of May had the highest number of successful campaigns, followed closely by June.  There was a bigger variance in the number of successful campaigns based on launch date than there was in the variance of failed campaigns.  
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Generally, the lower the fundraising goal, the more likely a campaign is going to be successful.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One limitation of this dataset is that it only focuses on Kickstarter data.  There are many other crowdfunding websites that may offer different insights into crowdfunding.  
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Column or bar charts could be used to display this data as well, especially for the outcomes based on goals.
